Hello, I'm a back-end developer in Go-lang. My name is **** (i won't tell you üòè).
- proud Go dev üòé
- finished every project that i started üòé yep, yea üòÅ
- know python, have 3+ experience in it üêç (tired of it)
- will write javascript/typescript under gun point (no, please no üò¢üò≠)

# 2025
So, ***a lot has happened*** since the last time i updated this page. Good, bad and terrible things. I've tried a lot of things, i did a lot of things
*(A lot of projects i did, i didn't pushed to github because i didn't consider quality of my work good enough to be pushed (i regret it, but i have all my projects zipped. I learned a lesson: when you push, you see progress, and it motivates you)*.
So, how was these 3 years for me (2023 to 2025)? I procrastinated a lot, i admit, but, i've learned a lot. I dropped out of university on the end of second course, because that's how successful people usually do üòè. JK, university wasn't for me, i didn't feel like i was learning anything useful, didn't feel like this knowledge will help me to get a job and do work on a job, and i only felt like i'm loosing time. But i liked strict regime and schedule, and social side of talking to classmates, so overall i enjoyed it.

Right now i'm working on few projects in Go language. I won't tell you, its a secret ü§´, just wait till they'll be finished. I promise they'll be useful, and i hope you'll like em üòäüòá

## A little bit of ranting

From the last time, i said javascript is my favourite language. Lmao, no. Javascript is terrible. **Terrible**. And `typescript` is not an upgrade, its a downgrade. It can't be considered a standalone language. All amazing code you write will turn back into shitty javascript, with no gains of performance from static typing, you'll only loose performance form transpiling it back to javascript. JSDoc is a better alternative, and JSDoc really improves programming experience.
Javascript is a joke language, its a language for those people who enjoy pain. **I'm not one of them**. Seeing how [deno](https://deno.com/) improved and [bun](https://bun.sh/) came out, javascript-typescript has a chance to be useful and nice to write (based on performance, tooling and standard library). But, not for me.
Considering i'm not a frontend dev and i hate working with html/css, even tho I may enjoy designing something in [figma](https://www.figma.com/), but rebuilding it with html/css is a pain. CSS has deprecated methods that are not gonna be removed to support old browsers (for no reason at all, people should move already and use fresher software and hardware). but i like how [bun outperforms go](https://youtu.be/qB422eeOFr8?si=9OkLZ9UaEFGX1yJn) in the [benchmark](https://youtu.be/ECnlX00YcPI?si=xENIUhZa2HffvlLs) on small load, so writing backend in javascript is a good idea for small projects and small traffic.

Since last time i've tried nim, zig, rust, go.
- Nim was okay-kinda-language, not good, not terrible. Give it time and u'll see it will shine and replace python (not fully, lol, it will never happen. But what will happen: people will choose nim to write simple projects/scripts, instead of python, as its portable/fast and statically typed (aka safe), with GC).
For now its raw. I like size of binary files it produces, much lower than Go, as Nim, as its basically a C wrapper (stupid to say but im tired of writing this huge post no-one gonna read). I like how "easy" it is to write something fast, and compiler is quite nice as well. But for big projects it will become pain same way as python is. I didn't liked the syntax, linters aren't ready, and small amount of packages.
- Zig is good, better than rust, it has no macros (which is good, macros are evil. They slower down compiling speed significantly, and how they are made is rust is terrible, its basic text editing. Flexible but unsafe-stupid), syntax is C-like but safer-easier-better, tooling is good (there's no cmake files, only zig.build, in zig syntax. Its awesome). I will choose it for my next big projects, "game" engines (like [this guy did](https://www.youtube.com/@MadrigalGames)), games, etc..
> Personal take on C language:
as a language should-must be dead, it has outlived itself, zig is a new C ([C3](https://c3-lang.org/) go away). I don't respect [linus torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) [decision](https://youtu.be/8QcQ_128OIw?si=yHLY-TsXZxxp02PU) on maintaining linux. Core of linux should be migrated to other safe languages like rust or zig, and new pull requests should not try to rely on existing c code and try to adjust to work with C, no, C should adjust to work with Zig/Rust.
- Rust is safe, but too much of a hustle to write. I tried, and i support rust, but its not for me. I like the joke "rewrite it in rust", but would be nicer if people also said "rewrite it in Zig".
- Go - is the best language i've tried yet. It solves 3 main issues i had: 1) its easy to build something fast 2) it has interfaces, structs, statically typed and generics. 3) performance and multi-threading is incredible.
With python i struggled with overcomplicated code. I tried to code in it like if i was programming in rust. I Used results, used beartype for dynamic static typing. If python gives me an opportunity to overload class dunder methods, i'll do it, to make my library more pythonic. But it slows me down and adds unnecessary complexity. What i'm trying to say, i tried to utilize everything python gave me, as it has many cool features, and my code grew larger, without actual project logic that project needed. Also it slowed down performance of my library/app.
Go on the other hand has limited amount of features, which means you won't be able to overcomplicate something because you have ability todo so (because language has such features). 
Go is not pythonic, in fact, in go you write simple code, In go you have interfaces (i lacked interfaces in python, they are gamechanger). It doesn't have default variables, which is good. Go as a language forces you to think in other way when writing something, in the way that will make it more error prone, more flexible and understandable. Single code style. I learned plugin-driven, config/options design patterns. They helped me a lot. With go i feel like i'm working on a useful project.
And also, as go was originally designed to be a backend language, and is used for backend and scripts, writing backend projects/apps/libraries/frameworks (which is mostly what i like todo) feels like at home. Also linter for vscode is well-damn made!

About Go. At first i didn't liked it, it seemed weird (all these imports via links to github like wtf). But over time, i understood, that it significantly helps you code. Also i liked how you can split one file into many files in same folder, and you'll be able to use any code snipped from other file without import, because it will treat it as a single file, its amazing, and another game changer.

# Now, to old introduction:

My journey started in 2019. I chose the C# language. The reason was Unity. 
I wanted to make games, i liked Unity, so i chosen it.
I had no expirience in programming, i knew nothing at this time.

# my history:
## ü•öFirst try: Unity, C# and 3d modelling
### **C#** and **Unity**

C# i learned from **Sololearn**.
The app had good UI and great-understandable education, with quizes after chapter.
I got a Certificate at the end üòÑ.

Mine first big step in programming was a script ,
where u could draw on ASCII screen with ASCII characters.
![screenshot](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/580394781474160641/1048649174326968340/first.png?width=1403&height=701)
It had also a cute cursor and debug at the top.
Movement was via arrow keys, and to draw u would need to press Enter.
Later i added colors (RGB).

But i could not use C# anymore.
I felt like C# was not good for me, and i wanted to try another language.

### *3d modelling*

Also i wanted to try myself as a 3d Designer.
I started with 3d max. I learned it by following youtube tutorials.

The guy i learned the most was (Big thx to him):

## üê£Second Try
### **C++**
after C# I tried C++. There were reasons:
1) it was fast and file sizes was small
2) it was used by Unreal Engine , and i thought if i cannot stay with Unity, i can stay with Unreal Engine

I learned it also in **Sololearn** app. Got some basic knowladge.
But c++ was also not for me and I didn't stay here for long.

## üê§Third try: 
### **Python**
it was 2020 year. (11 class)

I decided to try something with high level.
Also we study Python in school, and most of the information i got from classes/lectures.
I hated school, but meet every single programming lesson üòÑ.

Also i was learning python by myself when there was no classes at this day.

First project was password brootforcer:

and then i started practicing a lot. I stayed on it until 2021.
I started feeling that with python i could not do projects that i want.
Felt like python is not capeable with my needs.

## üïäÔ∏è ~~Current time~~
### **Javascript**

~~And finally i found what i needed. Switching from python to Javascript was hard at first.
I had no clue what am i doing üòÑ. But i kept trying.
I learned Javascript from several resources , unlike in other times.~~
Sources where i learned Javascript from:

```
Youtuber FireShip (Huge thx to him):
https://www.youtube.com/c/Fireship

MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/docs/Web/JavaScript
javascript.info: https://javascript.info/
w3schools: https://www.w3schools.com/js/

also started practicing on codewars:
https://www.codewars.com/users/PIXSYM

and created github
```
i did not knew Html and Css, so i went to **node.js**.

When i understood it successfully, ~~***i knew, this is my love*** üíú~~ (not anymore lol)

~~i tried bunch of packages:~~ (actually more, i just don't remember half of them)
```
node-fetch
jsdom
puppeteer
express.js
inquirer
```

~~Poem about javascript from chatGPT:~~ (f#ck it, its cringe)
```javascript
`
Violets are blue,
JavaScript is my love,
And my heart is true.
My love for it will never die,
Even though it makes me cry.
But when it comes to coding,
My love for it is unyielding.
So here's to my one true love,
JavaScript from above.
But little did I know, my love for JavaScript will make me broke...

But despite the cost and endless woes,
I'll keep coding to my hearts repose
For JavaScript is my guiding light,
It helps me code into the night
I'll never let it go, you see
For JavaScript is a part of me
So though the journey may be rough,
I'll keep coding, that's enough
For I am a true programmer,
Forever in love with JavaScript's splendor.`
```
