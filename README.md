# my history:
## ü•öFirst try: Unity, C# and 3d modelling
### **C#** and **Unity**

C# i learned from **Sololearn**.
The app had good UI and great-understandable education, with quizes after chapter.
I got a Certificate at the end üòÑ.

Mine first big step in programming was a script ,
where u could draw on ASCII screen with ASCII characters.

It had also a cute cursor and debug at the top.
Movement was via arrow keys, and to draw u would need to press Enter.
Later i added colors (RGB).

But i could not use C# anymore.
I felt like C# was not good for me, and i wanted to try another language.

### *3d modelling*

Also i wanted to try myself as a 3d Designer.
I started with 3d max. I learned it by following youtube tutorials.

The guy i learned the most was (Big thx to him):

## üê£Second Try
### **C++**
after C# I tried C++. There were reasons:
1) it was fast and file sizes was small
2) it was used by Unreal Engine , and i thought if i cannot stay with Unity, i can stay with Unreal Engine

I learned it also in **Sololearn** app. Got some basic knowladge.
But c++ was also not for me and I didn't stay here for long.

## üê§Third try: 
### **Python**
it was 2020 year. (11 class)

I decided to try something with high level.
Also we study Python in school, and most of the information i got from classes/lectures.
I hated school, but meet every single programming lesson üòÑ.

Also i was learning python by myself when there was no classes at this day.

First project was password brootforcer:

and then i started practicing a lot. I stayed on it until 2021.
I started feeling that with python i could not do projects that i want.
Felt like python is not capeable with my needs.

## üïäÔ∏è Current time
## **Javascript**

And finally i found what i needed. Switching from python to Javascript was hard at first.
I had no clue what am i doing üòÑ. But i kept trying.
I learned Javascript from several resources , unlike in other times.

Sources where i learned Javascript from:

```
Youtuber FireShip (Huge thx to him):
https://www.youtube.com/c/Fireship

MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/docs/Web/JavaScript
javascript.info: https://javascript.info/
w3schools: https://www.w3schools.com/js/

also started practicing on codewars:
https://www.codewars.com/users/PIXSYM

and created github
```
i did not knew Html and Css, so i went to **node.js**.

When i understood it successfully, ***i knew, this is my love*** üíú

i tried bunch of packages:
```
node-fetch
jsdom
puppeteer
express.js
inquirer
```
