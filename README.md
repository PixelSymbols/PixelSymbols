![img](https://www.codewars.com/users/PIXSYM/badges/large developer focused on Go.  
- Proud Go dev  
- Finished every project I started  
- 3+ years of Python (over it)  
- Will only write JS/TS under duress

### 2025 Update
Dropped out of university after two years‚Äîdidn‚Äôt find it useful for real-world skills, but enjoyed the structure and social side.  
Currently working on several Go projects (details coming soon).

### Languages Tried
- **Go:** My favorite‚Äîsimple, fast, with great concurrency and interfaces.
- **Python:** Used for years, but found it too easy to overcomplicate things.
- **Rust:** Safe but too complex for my taste.
- **Zig:** Like it for future projects‚Äîsimple, fast, no macros.
- **Nim:** Interesting, but raw and lacking packages.
- **C#:** Started with Unity, but moved on.
- **C++:** Tried for Unreal Engine, but didn‚Äôt stick.

### My Programming Journey
- Started in 2019 with C# and Unity (wanted to make games)
- Tried 3D modeling in 3ds Max
- Moved to C++, then Python (school and self-taught)
- Learned JavaScript (not a fan anymore), practiced on Codewars and Node.js

I prefer backend, dislike frontend (HTML/CSS), but enjoy designing in Figma.  
Always learning, always building.  
Thanks for stopping by!
