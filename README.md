## 😃 About Me

🍩 Donate | [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/~pixelsymbols) | [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/PIXSYM) | [sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/pixelsymbols)

😎🦫 developer focused on Go.  
- Proud Go dev  
- Finished every project I started  
- 3+ years of Python (over it)  
- Will only write JS/TS under duress

### 🆕 2025 Update
Dropped out of university after two years—didn’t find it useful for real-world skills, but enjoyed the structure and social side.  
Currently working on several Go projects (details coming soon).


### 🛠️ Languages Tried
- 🐹 **Go:** My favorite—simple, fast, with great concurrency and interfaces.
- 🐍 **Python:** Used for years, but found it too easy to overcomplicate things.
- 🦀 **Rust:** Safe but too complex for my taste.
- 🦎 **Zig:** Like it for future projects—simple, fast, no macros.
- 🦕 **Nim:** Interesting, but raw and lacking packages.
- 🎮 **C#:** Started with Unity, but moved on.
- ⚙️ **C++:** Tried for Unreal Engine, but didn’t stick.

### 🚀 My Programming Journey
- Started in 2019 with C# and Unity (wanted to make games)
- Tried 3D modeling in 3ds Max
- Moved to C++, then Python (school and self-taught)
- Learned JavaScript (not a fan anymore), practiced on Codewars and Node.js

I prefer backend, dislike frontend (HTML/CSS), but enjoy designing in Figma.  
Always learning, always building.
